**Particular Universes Playtest Session A**

Please discuss and answer as a group.
Shuffle the A cards and play a couple of rounds.

1. Are the provided rules and explanation sufficient? What’s missing?
There are some unclear parts in the rules. For example, let's say that I have both a card entity and a card
independent continuant on the board. Can I put my card "dog" under entity? Or do I have to put it - independent continuant?
If the former is the case, then the game risks being too easy.


2. Are there sufficient cards in the deck? Or too many?
There are enough cards.


3. Should there be more cards of any particular kind in the deck e.g. more or
less occurrent, object, generically dependent continuant cards, etc.?
It would be interesting to have some more cards that are dependent entities (roles, GDCs, etc.).
There were a lot of material objects.


4. What other text or picture cards could be added to extend the existing
themes (cat, dog, box and space)
Some text cards like "being a student" to represent roles or "the area in front of you house" for spatial regions/sites etc.


5. Do players win too quickly, or does it take too long to win?
We played by letting each player play all the cards they could in one turn
until they were stopped by some counterargument. This resulted in very long turns. 
It took us 3.30 hours to finish one game.

6. If there were spectators watching you play the game, did they engage in the
discussions? Or join the game?
There were no non-playing spectators.

7. What additional cards could be added to for “quality” relative to the existing
themes?
Some more instances which are not material entities.
Some more cards to erase the board.

Add the B cards to the deck, shuffle and play a couple of rounds.

1. Are there too many cards now or does it work?


2. Does it take longer to win? Too long?


3. What additional cards could be added to augment the B cards (e.g. function,
immaterial entities, temporal region, etc.) relative to existing themes?


4. What additional themes (text and picture cards) could be added to the game
relative to the B cards?


**Particular Universes playtest session 3** Not played

Please discuss and answer as a group

For each round in this session, deal each player 6 cards plus one blank card,
and play the game.
During the course of the round each player can write on their card and play it
in the game.
After each round, these cards should be shuffled into the deck with the other
cards and become part of the game.

*please use a pencil so the cards can be reused
**please do not add wildcards
***you can write and play your card immediately, or add it somewhere in
the deck for another player to draw
****blank cards can be written in secret, or decide together what cards
should be added

1. Do your cards make sense as you play? In subsequent rounds did other
players draw your cards and play them as intended?


2. Do you think that writing cards should be part of the final game?


3. What new picture cards (particulars) could be added to support your new
cards?


**Particular Universes playtest overall**

1. Is the game fun to play?
Yes, very much.

2. What did you like most about the game?
It added even more weight to the usual ontology debates, it also allowed us to make this 
a social communal experience.

3. Was there anything you didn’t like about the game?
We were a bit lost about the way to implement certain rules (see previous reply).

4. What new rules might make the game more fun, entertaining, informative, or
challenging?
Obliging people to play cards on the most specific part of the hierarchy.

5. Can you suggest any new wildcards?
Perhaps one to reshuffle the cards in the deck?

6. Can you suggest any aesthetic additions or improvements for the game?
Aesthetically cards were all good.

7. Can you suggest any additions or improvements for understandability?
Some short clearer rules on how to deal with cards already on the board,
how many cards one can play, and how to vote whether people agree with the
placement of cards on the board.

8. How much prior introduction to the BFO ontology do you feel is necessary to
play this game?
A bit, but it's also a good teaching tool.


9. Could this game be played by total beginners?
Yes but perhaps with some help on a side to identify BFO classes (e.g. definitions).


10. How does the gameplay compare to listening to a lecture on the ontology,
or reading a publication?
It's learning by doing plus gamification, moreover it's collaborative. 
I think it's great, you can learn more in one session compared to a class of the same length.


11. Please share any feedback, suggestions for improvement, or
intuitions you had while playing the game.
Some more info about the way the actual gameplay goes on is needed, but otherwise everything went fine.
