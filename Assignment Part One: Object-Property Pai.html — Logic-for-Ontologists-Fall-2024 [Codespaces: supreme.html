"PROVIDE OWL-2 DIRECT SEMANTIC BASED EXPLANATIONS
FOR UNSATISFIABILITY AND INCONSISTENCY RESULTS
STEMMING FROM ROLE CONSTRAINT PAIRS."


1.) FUNCTIONAL COMBINED WITH TRANSITIVE BECOMES UNDECIDEABLE

According to functional object property, if xRy and xRz then y = z 

By transitive, if xRy, yRz, then xRz where x,y and z are distinct.

xRy and xRz cannot hold simultaneously because this violates cardinality of functional object properties. 



2.) INVERSE-FUNCTIONALITY AND TRANSITIVITY BECOMES UNDECIDEABLE

By inverse object property, if xRy and zRy then x = z. 

By transitive, if zRx and xRy then zRy, where x,y and z are distinct.

zRy and xRy cannot hold simultaneously because only one instance can relate to y by virtue of cardinality. 



3.) SYMMETRY + A-SYMMETRY = UNSATISFIABLE 

By Symmetry, if xRy then yRx

By Asymmetry, if xRy, then ~(yRx)

These statements will always contradict each other. 



4.) A-SYMMETRY + TRANSITIVITY = UNDECIDEABLE

By asymmetry if xRy then ~(yRx)

By transitive, if xRy, yRz, and zRx then yRx.

yRx and ~(yRx) cannot hold at once. 



5.) TRANSITIVE + IRREFLEXIVE = UNDECIDEABLE

By irreflexive, ~(xRx).

By transitive, if xRy and yRx then xRx. 

Since some symmetrical statements paired with a transitive expression become reflexive, this violates the conditions of irreflexive object property. 



6.) ASYMMETRICAL + REFLEXIVE = UNSATISFIABLE

By Asymmetry if xRy then ~(yRx). 

By reflexive, xRx.

Although symmetry refers to two separate statements, a reflexive statement is inherently symmetric to itself which violates asymmetry. 




7.) REFLEXIVE + IRREFLEVITY = UNSATISFIABLE

By reflexive, xRx

By irreflexive, ~(xRx)

These statements cannot together will result in a contradiction.
