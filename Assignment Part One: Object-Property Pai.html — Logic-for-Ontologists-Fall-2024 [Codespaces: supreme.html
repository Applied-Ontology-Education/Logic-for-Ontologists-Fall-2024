Assignment Part One: Object-Property Pair contradictions.

"PROVIDE OWL-2 DIRECT SEMANTIC BASED EXPLANATIONS
FOR UNSATISFIABILITY AND INCONSISTENCY RESULTS
STEMMING FROM ROLE CONSTRAINT PAIRS."

1.) FUNCTIONAL COMBINED WITH TRANSITIVE BECOMES UNDECIDEABLE

Functional object property denotes cardinality of (1) such relationship between 2 instances.
For example, John (x) is connected to Steve (y) by object-property "has father" is unique.
That is, Steve (y) can only bear the object-property relationship "has_father" with one other individual, namely, John (x).

Transitive object-property goes according to the following:
(x) relates to (y) by object-property 1 and (y) related to (z) by same object-property 1, 
So (x) also relates to (z) by virture of object-property 1.
x --> y, y --> z Therefore x --> z

When running a reasoner the combination of these becomes undecideable because a functional property must only be only be obtained between one individual and another,
however, if it is applied transitively it whill carry over to subsequent pairs who are also connected by this same object property.


2.) INVERSE-FUNCTIONALITY AND TRANSITIVITY BECOMES UNDECIDEABLE

Inverse functionality provides that each individual paired with another with this relation can have at most one incoming connection of said object property.
Ex: Inverse_Functional_Property "father of";
    Father_of (Joey, Richard)      = "Joey is father_of Richard"
--> This means that the instance, Richard, can only be inverse-fucntionally related to Joey and no other instance because any person can only have one father.
--> Conversely the object-property "father_of" may be obtained between Joey and other instances, who will only have this relation which Joey. 

Transitive object-property goes according to the following:
(x) relates to (y) by object-property 1 and (y) related to (z) by same object-property 1, 
So (x) also relates to (z) by virture of object-property 1.
x --> y, y --> z Therefore x --> z

When running a reasoner the combination of these becomes undecideable because a functional property must only be only be obtained between one individual and another,
however, if it is applied transitively it whill carry over to subsequent pairs who are also connected by this same object property.


3.) SYMMETRY + A-SYMMETRY = UNSATISFIABLE 

Symmetry declares that if (x) is related to (y) by object_property_1, then (y) is related to (x) by virtue of same object_property_1
Ex: Symmtric_Object_Property (sister)
    Object_Property_Assertion (sister, Mary, Jen)  = "Mary is sister of Jen"
    It follows that "Jen is sister of Mary" because the relation is symmetrically held between both instances. 

Asymmetry provides that if (x) is related to (y) by object_property_3 then (y) CANNOT relate to (x) by object_property_3
Ex: Asymmetric_Object_Property (Parent_of)
    Object_Property_Assertion (parent_of, Vivian, Chris)  = "Vivian is a parent of Chris"
    It holds that Chris CANNOT be a parent of Vivian. 

The joint of these leads to unsatisfiability because an object property cannot relate mutually between instances while also only applying one direction between one to the other.
Thus, the result will always be false because both cannot be achieved simulataneously. 


4.) A-SYMMETRY + TRANSITIVITY = UNDECIDEABLE

Asymmetry provides that if (x) is related to (y) by object_property_3 then (y) CANNOT relate to (x) by object_property_3
Ex: Asymmetric_Object_Property (Parent_of)
    Object_Property_Assertion (parent_of, Vivian, Chris)  = "Vivian is a parent of Chris"
    It holds that Chris CANNOT be a parent of Vivian. 
 
Transitive object-property goes according to the following:
(x) relates to (y) by object-property 1 and (y) related to (z) by same object-property 1, 
So (x) also relates to (z) by virture of object-property 1.
x --> y, y --> z Therefore x --> z

If there is an object property that holds as both asymmetrical and transitive, it is possible that an instance (y) could relate to (x) as both bearer and recipient
of some object property if this object property is shared between other instances and (x). Thus the reasoner could not decide between whom it holds. 



5.) TRANSITIVE + IRREFLEXIVE = UNDECIDEABLE

Transitive object-property goes according to the following:
(x) relates to (y) by object-property 1 and (y) related to (z) by same object-property 1, 
So (x) also relates to (z) by virture of object-property 1.
x --> y, y --> z Therefore x --> z

Irreflexive hold that no individual can be connected by such an object property to itself.

Syllogism: 

Transitive Property Assertion: brother_of
Irreflexive Property assertion: brother_of 

    x is brother of y
    y is brother of z
    z is brother of x
Therefore, x is brother to itself. 

This leads to a contradiction because x cannot be brother to itself by virtue of irreflexivity. 



6.) ASYMMETRICAL + REFLEXIVE = UNSATISFIABLE

Asymmetry provides that if (x) is related to (y) by object_property_3 then (y) CANNOT relate to (x) by object_property_3
Ex: Asymmetric_Object_Property (Parent_of)
    Object_Property_Assertion (parent_of, Vivian, Chris)  = "Vivian is a parent of Chris"
    It holds that Chris CANNOT be a parent of Vivian. 

Reflexivity holds that an instance can relate to itself by some object property, (aRa) where a is some instance. 

If (x) relates to some (y) and why, in turn, this (y) is able to point back to (x) by virtue of (x)'s reflexivity then this would lead to a contradiction. 


7.) REFLEXIVE + IRREFLEVITY = UNSATISFIABLE

Irreflexive hold that no individual can be connected by such an object property to itself.

Reflexivity holds that an instance can relate to itself by some object property, (aRa) where a is some instance.

If some instance (x) has object property that relates to itself concatenated with another that is mutually exclusive of itself then this will 
lead to a contradiction as both conditions cannot be satisfied at once.
