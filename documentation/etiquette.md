# Open Source Etiquette

- Be respectful in your requests and comments.
- Do not include any private information.
- GitHub sends notifications to your email, and you can respond via your email client. However, responses are posted publicly. Be sure to delete your email signature if it includes personal information, such as your phone number.
- Many ontologies have limited resources and personnel for development and maintenance. Please be patient with your requests.
- If your ticket/request has been unanswered for a long period of time, you may check in by commenting on the ticket.
