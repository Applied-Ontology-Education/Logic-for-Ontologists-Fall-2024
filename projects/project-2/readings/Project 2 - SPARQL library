1. Detect Classes Without Any Instances (Level 8 - 0 points)

Title: Empty Class Detection
Constraint Description: Identifies classes that have no instances associated with them.
Severity: Warning

PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
SELECT ?class
WHERE {
  ?class a rdfs:Class .
  FILTER NOT EXISTS {
    ?instance a ?class .
  }
}

Purpose: ​This query retrieves all classes that do not have any instances associated with them.​ 
It uses FILTER NOT EXISTS to ensure that only classes without any defined instances are selected,helping to identify potentially unused or unnecessary classes in the ontology.

2. Identifying Disjoint Classes with Common Instances

Title: Disjoint Class Violation
Constraint Description: Detects instances that belong to classes declared as disjoint.
Severity: Error

PREFIX owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
SELECT ?class1 ?class2 ?instance
WHERE {
  ?instance a ?class1 .
  ?instance a ?class2 .
  ?class1 owl:disjointWith ?class2 .
}

The primary intention of this query is to identify pairs of classes that are designated as disjoint but have instances that belong to both classes.​ 
This situation indicates a potential inconsistency within the ontology since disjoint classes should not share any instances.

Running this query enables to detect potential issues in the class hierarchy and relationships, ensuring the integrity of the ontology is maintained. 

3. Detecting Unused Object Properties (level 7 - 2 points)

Title: Unused Object Property Detection
Constraint Description: Identifies object properties that are defined but not used in any instances.
Severity: Warning

PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#>
SELECT ?property
WHERE {
  ?property a owl:ObjectProperty .
  FILTER NOT EXISTS {
    ?subject ?property ?object .
  }
}

​The aim of this query is to identify object properties within the ontology that are defined but not utilized in any instances.​ 
Detecting such unused properties helps maintain a clean and efficient ontology by identifying potentially redundant definitions.

4. Finding Classes with Conflicting Disjointness and Subclass Relationships

Title: Disjoint Subclass Conflict
Constraint Description: Identifies classes that are marked as disjoint but share a common superclass.
Severity: Error

PREFIX owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
SELECT ?class1 ?class2
WHERE {
  ?class1 owl:disjointWith ?class2 .
  ?class1 rdfs:subClassOf ?commonSuperclass .
  ?class2 rdfs:subClassOf ?commonSuperclass .
}

The goal of this query is to identify classes that are marked as disjoint but are simultaneously defined as subclasses of a common superclass.​ 
This situation presents a logical inconsistency within the ontology, as disjoint classes should not share any common subclasses.

5. Identifying Classes with Different Labeling Standards

Title: Inconsistent Class Labeling
Constraint Description: Detects classes with different labeling standards.
Severity: Warning

PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#>
SELECT ?class ?label1 ?label2
WHERE {
  ?class a owl:Class .
  ?class rdfs:label ?label1 .
  ?otherClass a owl:Class .
  ?otherClass rdfs:label ?label2 .
  FILTER(?class != ?otherClass) 
  FILTER(?label1 != ?label2)
}

The goal of this query is to find classes within an ontology that are associated with different labeling standards.​ 
This can be important for identifying inconsistencies in how classes are labeled or described, which can help improve the quality and usability of the ontology.

6. Identifying Potentially Overspecified Class Definitions

Title: Overspecified Class Detection
Constraint Description: Identifies classes with potentially redundant or overlapping property definitions.
Severity: Warning

PREFIX owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
SELECT ?class ?property1 ?property2 ?definition1 ?definition2
WHERE {
  ?class a owl:Class .
  ?class ?property1 ?definition1 .
  ?class ?property2 ?definition2 .
  FILTER(?property1 != ?property2) 
}

The aim of this query is to identify classes within an ontology that may have overspecified definitions.​ 
This occurs when a class is defined with multiple properties that provide overlapping or redundant constraints, potentially leading to confusion or misinterpretation of the class's intent.

7. Detecting Equivalent Properties with Different Ranges

Title: Inconsistent Equivalent Property Ranges
Constraint Description: Identifies equivalent properties with different range specifications.
Severity: Error

PREFIX owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
SELECT ?property1 ?property2 ?range1 ?range2
WHERE {
  ?property1 a owl:ObjectProperty .
  ?property2 a owl:ObjectProperty .
  ?property1 owl:equivalentProperty ?property2 .
  ?property1 rdfs:range ?range1 .
  ?property2 rdfs:range ?range2 .
  FILTER(?range1 != ?range2)
}

The goal of this query is to identify pairs of object properties that are defined as equivalent but have different specified ranges.​ 
This discrepancy can indicate potential issues in the ontology's design, as equivalent properties should maintain consistent range definitions to ensure accurate data interpretation.

8. Analyzing Class Hierarchies for Inconsistent Type Definitions

Title: Inconsistent Class Type Definition
Constraint Description: Detects classes assigned multiple, different types.
Severity: Error

PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#>
SELECT ?class ?type1 ?type2
WHERE {
  ?class a ?type1 .
  ?class a ?type2 .
  FILTER(?type1 != ?type2)
  FILTER(?type1 != rdfs:Class && ?type2 != rdfs:Class)
}

The primary objective of this query is to identify classes assigned multiple types in an ontology that differ from each other.​ 
Inconsistent type definitions can create ambiguity regarding the intended semantics of the classes and lead to erroneous interpretations in data retrieval and reasoning.

9. Detecting Potentially Misplaced Inverse Object Properties (Level 5 - 5 points)

Title: Unused Inverse Property Detection
Constraint Description: Identifies inverse object properties without corresponding instance relationships.
Severity: Warning

PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#>
SELECT ?property1 ?property2
WHERE {
  ?property1 a owl:ObjectProperty .
  ?property2 a owl:ObjectProperty .
  ?property1 owl:inverseOf ?property2 .
  FILTER NOT EXISTS {
    ?instance1 ?property1 ?instance2 .
    ?instance2 ?property2 ?instance1 .
  }
}

This query object properties defined as inverses within the ontology without corresponding instances illustrating those relationships. 
This lack of practical implementation can signify potential design flaws within the ontology framework.

10. Identifying Classes with No Properties (Level 4 - 10 points)

Title: Empty Class Property Detection
Constraint Description: Detects classes that have no properties defined.
Severity: Warning

PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
SELECT ?class
WHERE {
  ?class a rdfs:Class .
  FILTER NOT EXISTS {
    ?class ?property ?value .
    FILTER(?property != rdf:type)
  }
}

This query identifies classes within the ontology that lack properties, aside from their classification as types. 
Classes devoid of properties may fail to provide relevant information about their instances, rendering them ineffective in conveying knowledge.

11. Identifying Classes Without Labels (Level 4 - 10 points)

Title: Missing Class Label Detection
Constraint Description: Identifies classes that lack human-readable labels.
Severity: Warning

PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
SELECT ?class
WHERE {
  ?class a rdfs:Class .
  FILTER NOT EXISTS { ?class rdfs:label ?label }
}

This query seeks to surface classes that lack human-readable labels. 
Labels are vital for enabling users to understand the ontology’s structure, and their absence may hamper usability.

12. Detecting Missing Annotations (Labels or Comments) (Level 4 - 10 points)

Title: Missing Annotation Detection
Constraint Description: Identifies ontology elements missing both labels and comments.
Severity: Warning

PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
SELECT ?element
WHERE {
  ?element a ?type .
  FILTER(?type IN (rdf:Property, rdfs:Class, owl:ObjectProperty, owl:DatatypeProperty))
  FILTER NOT EXISTS { ?element rdfs:label ?label }
  FILTER NOT EXISTS { ?element rdfs:comment ?comment }
}

This query identifies ontology elements missing critical annotations, such as labels or comments. 
These annotations provide context and clarify the purpose of each element, which is essential for effective ontology utilization.

13. Detecting Properties Shared Across Multiple Classes (Level 3 - 20 points)

Title: Shared Property Analysis
Constraint Description: Identifies properties used by instances of multiple classes.
Severity: Warning

PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
SELECT ?property ?class1 ?class2
WHERE {
  ?property a rdf:Property .
  ?instance1 a ?class1 .
  ?instance1 ?property ?value .
  ?instance2 a ?class2 .
  ?instance2 ?property ?value .
  FILTER(?class1 != ?class2)
}

This query evaluates properties employed by instances of multiple classes, revealing shared relations that could indicate a broader conceptualization within the ontology.

14. Detecting Inconsistent Property Ranges Across Subclass Hierarchies (Level 3 - 20 points)

Title: Inconsistent Subclass Property Range
Constraint Description: Detects inconsistencies in property ranges within class hierarchies.
Severity: Error

PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#>
SELECT ?property ?class1 ?range1 ?class2 ?range2
WHERE {
  ?property a rdf:Property .
  ?class1 ?property ?value1 .
  ?value1 a ?range1 .
  ?class2 rdfs:subClassOf ?class1 .
  ?class2 ?property ?value2 .
  ?value2 a ?range2 .
  FILTER(?range1 != ?range2)
}
