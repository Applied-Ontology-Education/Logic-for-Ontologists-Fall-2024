Trans.-Funct (NS)

Suppose that a relation R is both transitive and functional. 

Trans.-iFunct (NS)

Suppose that a relation

Asymm-Trans (NS)

Asymm-Symm (UNSAT) (done by JB)

Ref-Asymm (UNSAT)

Suppose that a relation R is both reflexive and asymmetric. By reflexivity, for any x, x is related to itself by R, i.e. xRx. By asymmetry, for any x and any y, if it is the case that xRy, then it is not the case that yRx. But for reflexivity, the only entities in R are x. That is, y=x. Plugging that in, we both have that xRx for reflexivity, and that it is not the case that xRx for asymmetry. This is thus not satisfiable.

Ref-Irref (UNSAT)

Suppose that a relation R is both reflexive and irreflexive. By reflexivity, we have that xRx. By irreflexivity, we have that it is not the case that xRx. This is not a satisfiable formula.
