# Particular Universes

## Top-Level Ontologies
There are a variety of top-level ontologies in the great wide world. Some align with the [ISO/IEC 21838-1](https://www.iso.org/standard/71954.html) standard, such as [Basic Formal Ontology](https://www.iso.org/standard/74572.html), the [Descriptive Ontology for Linguistics and Cognitive Engineering](https://www.iso.org/standard/78927.html), and [TUpper](https://www.iso.org/standard/78928.html). Others exist in alignment with other standards bodies or [indeed outside](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_ontology) of such trappings. 

By now, I'm sure you know how [I feel about using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVR1_WsGXMQ) top-level ontologies and you know why [I favor BFO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuXoA3F5hBA). 

## Ontologies as Granular Partitions 
In truth, my preference is for a more complete picture of the world than one characterized by any single top-level ontology and its extensions. I am aiming - and would like you to help me aim - towards a future in which these putative rival top-level ontologies are used in real-world applications together, providing multiple perspectives on the same domain. 

In 1994, Andrew Wiles proved [Fermat's Last Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiles%27s_proof_of_Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem). It was and is still today truly a work of dedication and genius. It is hard to convey the surprise of this result. Students in my generation were raised believing no one would be able to prove this proposed theorem of Fermat that had been scribbled in the margins of a journal with the note "the proof is too long to include in the margins" all the way back in 1637. Prior to the proof it was listed as the "most difficult mathematical problem" by the Guinness Book of World Records. But Wiles pulled it off. Part of his strategy (and only a part, let's not be reductive here), was the disposition to - when confronted with a challenging mathematical problem - translate problems into different languages as a way to illuminate new potential solutions. Such translation work is hard, but worthwhile, obviously. 

Returning to the thread, the world is complex and full of challenging problems the solutions to which could bring major benefits to our lives. Barry used to like to say something to the effect that we probably have cures for various cancers buried in our datasets, but we cannot connect these datasets and so are unable to see these cures. I believe that insight is correct.

I add though that with integration or interoperability across datasets, there is still progress to be made, though less about what we don't know we know, and more about what we don't know we don't know. Put another way, my preference, my aim, our aim, is towards a future in which we leverage computing systems to translate - in a way analogous to Wiles - across different perspectives on the same domain, to illuminate new potential solutions. 

Now, I do not take this to be incompatible with advocating BFO. It is the most the top-level ontology for the largest ontology community in the world and has been the most vetted in real-world applications. In this respect, I take BFO as currently the best case strategy for providing - in at least one formal perspective - a near complete picture of the world, from top-level to domain-level, across a variety of domains of interest. 

## An Important Game

"What" I hear you thinking "does this have to do with our next project?" I'm so glad you asked. 

It should be clear from the preceding that though have been training in BFO and advocate for its adoption, it is important that we understand alternative top-level ontology perspectives. While my ultimate aim in encouraging such training is for that ideal future described above, such an exercise will have the added impact of sharpening your understanding of BFO itself. 

With that in mind, we shall be engaging in a playtest for an ontology game created by [Max Willis](https://www.maxwillis.net/index.html) and [Greta Adamo](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=greta+adamo&ia=web). We will, more specifically, be playing this game as a group in class where I will also provide the cards and hard copies of the rules needed to participate (as well as the consent form). To illustrate, rules of the game are: 

1) Each player will be dealt 7 cards.
2) If there are cards remaining after distribution, place them face down. 
3) Draw the top card from the face down pile and lay it face-side up* 
4) A random player is selected to go first; play then proceeds clockwise as follows: 
- When it is a player's turn, they must draw one card from the deck
- The player may then add an 'ontologically correct' card to the face-up card(s) on the table, describing the growing ontology as they proceed, e.g. “Kaido is an instance of material entity, which is an independent continuant” or “Dog is an independent continuant, a material entity, and Kaido is a particular dog.”
- When it is a plyer's turn, they may place any card they believe is ontologically correct.
- When it is a player's turn, they may choose to end their turn. 
- Any player can dispute the placement of a card; if the player of the card cannot defend their placement, they must remove their card and lose their turn; if they are able to defend their placement, they may continue placing cards or stop their turn.
5) The first player to place all of their cards wins the game. 

*If what is drawn is a wild card, then place the wild card back in the deck and draw until the result is not wild. 

We will discuss the details of these rules in more depth in class, with a particular emphasis on what "ontologically correct" means. 

## Assignment 

To complete this project, you are required to attend class and play the game. You will be expected to play the game and complete a short survey provided by the game developers. 

For those attending online, you may complete this project by either attending remotely during class time, in which I will guide you through play with the group. If you are unable to make it to any live sessions, then you may complete this project by recording you and a group of students from class playing the game. Again, to complete the assignment you must also complete a survey which will help the game developers refine this very intersting project.
