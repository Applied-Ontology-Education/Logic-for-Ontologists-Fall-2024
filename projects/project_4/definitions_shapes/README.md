This directory contains SHACL shapes created to represent implicit constraints present in the definitions of
BFO and CCO. They are originated using NAAS/GPT/Claude alongside different prompting techniques. The results
were generally of bad quality. We achieved some results by providing more module-specific patterns to 
NAAS/Claude to generate shapes for definitions in the Time ontology, which is the only module we considered 
qualitatively interesting enough to upload.
