PARTICULAR UNIVERSES ONTOLOGY GAME BFO EDITION. 2 Rounds Played.


QUESTIONS: 


1. "Are the provided rules and explanation sufficient? What's missing?"
   
    Answer: There ought to be additional rules. For example, instances of objects are too easy to place on the board as merely independent continuants. Their genus category (the universal which they instantiate) should have to be played first. That, in turn, should require that it's parent BFO category (object aggregate, spatial region, etc.) must be be played first as well.


2. "Are there sufficient cards in the deck? Or too many?"

    Answer: There seemed to be enough. However, I believe players should be given specific numbers of each kind of card-- instances, types, BFO ontological categories. This would ensure that each player has to reason through all the cards they are dealt with instead of being able to play many at once. For example, a player so happen to get all instances and some maximally general categories like continuant that are easily placed on the board. It also encourages more rigorous thinking and discussions.


3. "Should there be more cards of any particular kind in the deck...?"

    Answer: There seemed to be a lot of material entities and independent continuants. It would be good to have more dependent continuants, especially realizable entities. Perhaps this would spur some helpful insights into current entities in BFO that are categorically ambiguous or at least tenuous. 


4. "What other text picture cards could be added to extend the existing themes (cat, dog, box, space)?"

    Answer: I would argue for less objects overall. Inlcude more entities that are processes or spatial boundaries. Also text/picture cards should clarify if the meaning is a noun or verb, that is, "bark" as in the sound a dog makes or tree bark, for example.


5. "Do players win too quickly, or does it take too long to win?"

    Answer: It took way too long to make a single rotation of all the players. Players should have 5mins max to place and defend their cards. Should discussion become lengthy, the player always reserves the right to play another card once she has successfuly placed her last one. 


6. "If there were spectators watching you play the game, did they engage in the discussions? Or the game?"

    Answer: Everyone was involved and participated. The game elicits contentious arguments. This is good.


7. "What additional cards could be added to for "quality" relative to the exisiting themes?"

    Answer: Perhaps there should be a card that allows a player to re-assign a universal type or ontological category in a different way so it shifts the model. However, if a player does so they must ensure that the is_a heirarchy is maintained after this change. 



PARTICULAR UNIVERSES PLAYTEST OVERALL QUESTIONS:


1. "Is the game fun to play?"

    Answer: Absolutely. I also think it would be a unique way to flesh out debates about topics in BFO in a tangible way. That is, by playing the cards that represent the topics of those types of entities on the board. 


2. "What did you like most about the game?"

    Answer: The debate which followed each questionable placement of a card. That was a lot of fun-- and got out of hand a few times, too.


3. "Was there anything you didn't like about the game?"

    Answer: It took too much time for each person to finsih their turn. This made the game drag on too much.


4. "What new rules might make the game more fun, entertaining, informative, or challenging?

    Answer: Time limits per turn or card placement and number of cards that can be played at once of a certain type. For example only (2) instances maximum per turn. Maybe someone has to play a universal or BFO category first. 


5. "Can you suggest any new wildcards?"

    Answer: As mentioned, the ability to re-arrange the board while maintaining the is_a heirarchy of all descendants and ancestors from cards placed to that point. Maybe creating a new ontology that sits next to the original one which ultimately has to be bridged for the game to end. 


6. "Can you suggest any aesthetic additions or improvements for the game?"

    Answer: Definitely laminate the cards and give some description on the back that tells exactly what they are (for example, instance, universal).


7. "Can you suggest any additions or improvements for understandability?"

    Answer: Yes, as mentioned, specify what type of entity the card represents if it just has a word or picture on it.


8. "How much prior introduction to the BFO ontology do you feel is necessary to play this game?"

    Answer: At least an introductory course worth. There should also always be a "Building Ontologies with Basic Formal Ontology" book on hand; similiar to a dictionary while playing scrabble. 


9. "Could this game be played by total beginners?"

    Answer: I don't think so. It's too nuanced and all the best subtle parts of the game require some prior knowledge.
